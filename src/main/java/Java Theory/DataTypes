--> Datatypes are categorised into 2 types
        --> Primitive Datatypes
        --> Non-Primitive Datatypes.
--> Primitive Datatypes:- The datatypes which is supported by programming is called primitive datatypes. Also called pre-defined datatypes or inbuilt datatypes.
--> Non-Primitive Datatypes:- The datatypes which is supported by programmer or user is called non-primitive datatypes or user defined datatypes.

--> Primitive Datatypes :- Numeric:- Integer:- Byte(1byte), Short(2 bytes), int(4 bytes), long(8 bytes).
                                     Real Number:- Float(4 bytes), Double(8 bytes).
                           Non- Numeric:- Char(2 bytes).
                                          Boolean(1 bit).

--> Non- Primitive Datatypes:- Class, String, Array.

--> Identifiers:- A name in a given program is called identifiers. It can be method, class name or variable.
    Example:- class Demo(Class Name)
              public static void main(String[] args):- main is method Name.
              int i:- i is variable name


--> Rules of Identifiers
     --> The allowed character or upper case (A-Za-z).
     --> Identifiers cannot start with digit.
     --> Their is no length limit for identifiers but it is not recommended to give more than 15.
