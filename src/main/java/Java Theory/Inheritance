--> Acquiring property of one class by the other class is called inheritance.
--> Inheritance is achieved by using keyword 'extends'.
--> Inheritance is achieved by keeping all the common properties in one class, that is called parent,super or main class.
--> Acquiring properties from super class by the other class is called sub or child class.
--> Whenever we write 'extends' keyword the properties of parent class inherited to child class.
--> The child class object can be shared with parent and child class.
--> The super most class of java is object class.
--> Types of Inheritance
    --> Single Inheritance:- One class is extends by only one class.
        Example:- A(Super)<--B(Sub)
    --> Multi-Level Inheritance:- One class is extends by another class and intern that class is extends by other class.
        Example:- A<--B<--C
    --> Hierarchy:- One super class is extended by so many sub classes.
        Example:- A<--B
                  A<--C
                  A<--D
    --> Multiple:- Any sub class can inherit one super at a time but one sub class cannot inherit more then one class at a time because JVM get confused or it leads ambiguty.
    --> This kind of problem is known as diamond problem.
