--> It is one of the most powerful object oriented technology.
--> It is nothing but packing up the data code together.
--> It is not freely available outside of the class.
--> The main advantage of encapsulation is giving security to the data.
--> It can be achieved by using the concept of getters and setters or Java beans or POJO class(Plain Object Java Object).
--> Encapsulation is achieved by declaration the field in the class as private, while providing access to these builds via public typically it is a getters and setters method.
    Example:-
               private Mobile m;

               Setter:- public void Set m(Mobile m){
                           this.m = m;
                         }
               Getter:- public Mobile get m(){
                           return m;
                         }
