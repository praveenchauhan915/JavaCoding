--> Class is blueprint in Java.
--> Object is a real world entity which is having state and behaviour.
--> A class is also called as master copy or template.
--> A object is also called instance of a class.
--> If we want to create a object, class is required, without class we cannot create object.
--> Object are created from master copy or template.
--> By using single class we can create multiple objects.
--> Anything defined inside the class body is known as member of class.
--> If we declare the variable in the class body is known as data members.
--> If we define any methods in the class body we can call it as functional member of the class.
--> The state of the object is also called as fields.
--> The behaviour of the object is also called as action.


Reference Variable:- Is a variable which refers to the object and by using reference variable we can access states and behaviour which is present in a class.
                     New is a operator which allocates some memory for the object. JVM will create an object internally.
                     Example:- Remote r = new Remote();
                               Remote:- Class name
                               r = Reference Variable
                               new:- operator
                               Remote():- Constructor
                               new Remote():- Object
