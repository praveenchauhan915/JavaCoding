--> The Map interface in Java is part of the collection framework.
--> It represents a mapping between a set of keys and their corresponding values.
--> A map cannot contain duplicate key: each key can map to at most one value.
--> Map interface is used to store key-value pair, where each key is unique.

--> Hash Map:- Contains values based on the key.
               Contain only unique key.
               May have one null key and multiple null values.
               Non-Synchronized
               Maintains no insertion order.
--> Linked Hash Map:- Maintains insertion order
--> Tree Map:- Cannot hav null key but can have multiple null values.
               Maintains ascending order.
