--> It is a most powerful object oriented programming language.
--> Poly means many, morphism means forms, so polymorphism means many forms.
--> It is nothing but one method different behaviours is called polymorphism.
--> Type of Polymorphism
      --> Compile-time:- When type of the objects is determined at compile time by the compiler is called as compile time polymorphism.
                         Method overloading is nothing but compile time polymorphism.
                         It is also called static binding/early binding.
                         Overloaded method are bounded using compile time polymorphism.
      --> Run-time:- When type of the object is determined at run time by JVM is called as run-time polymorphism.
                     Method overriding is nothing but run-time polymorphism.
                     It is also called dynamic binding/ late binding.
                     Overridden method are bonded using run-time polymorphism.
                     Dynamic binding uses object to resolve the binding.
                     It is achieved by using the concept of inheritance.
