--> Interface is a media between two different system.
--> Interface contains only abstract method.
--> Abstract method is a method which is not having any implementation.
--> It is mandatory for a chile class to override the abstract method which is present inside the interface.
--> We cannot create an object of interface.
--> In interface can refer to any of the child class in the entire inheritance hierarchy.
--> We can achieve 100% abstraction in interface.
--> If any class is inheriting other interface, we have to use implements keyword.
--> If any interface is inheriting other interface, we have to use extends keyword.
--> A class can be the child of another class and interface but interface cannot be the child of any class.
--> Example:-
            interface ISwitch {
                  void clickA();
                  void clickB();
             }
            class LedLight implements ISwitch {
                public void clickA(){
                     S.O.Pln("LED Light Switch On")
                }
                public void clickB(){
                     S.O.Pln("LED Light Switch Off")
                }
             }
            class SolarLight implements ISwitch {
                public void clickA(){
                     S.O.Pln("Solar Light Switch On")
                }
                public void clickB(){
                     S.O.Pln("Solar Light Switch Off")
                }
            }
            public class Demo {
             public static void main(String[] aargs){
                  LedLight l = new LedLight();
                  l.clickA();
                  l.clickB();
              }
            }
            Output:- Led Light Switch On
                     Led Light Switch Off
