--> What is the difference between '=' and '=='?
    '==' is used to perform comparison operation and '==' is called as relational operators.
    '=' is used assign value to the variable and '=' is called as assignment operators.

--> What is the difference between '&' and '&&'?
   In single '&' if the first expression is false it will check for 2nd expression also.
   But '&&' if the first expression is false then it will not check 2nd expression(It would be considered as false itself).

--> Can we use all the method inside the the SOPln?
    Yes, we can call all the method except the method return type is void.
     Example:- public class calculator
               {
                  int add(int a, int b){
                        int c = a+b;
                        return c;
                  }
                  void sub(int x, int y){
                        int z = x-y;
                        S.O.Pln(z);
                  }
                  void mul(int p, int q){
                        int r = p*q;
                        S.O.Pln(r)
                  }
                  public static void main(String[] args){
                         Calculator c = new Calculator();
                         S.O.Pln(c.add(20,10));
                         c.sub(20,10);
                         c.mul(10,10);
                  }
               }
--> When to use abstract method and abstract class?
    Abstract method are usually declare with two or more sub class are expected to similar thing in a different way through different implementation for the abstract methods.
    Abstract class are used to define the generic types of behaviours are the top of the object oriented languages.

--> Difference between final, finally and finalize?
       Final:- final is the keyword and access modifier.
               The final keyword is used with the classes, methods and variables.
               Once declared, a final variable becomes a constant and cannot be modified.
               The final method is executed only when we call it.
       Finally:- finally is the block in java exception handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not.
                 Finally block is always related to the try-catch block in exception handling.
                 Finally block is executed as soon as the try-catch block is executed. Its execution not dependant on the exception.
       Finalize:- finalize is the method in Java that is used to perform cleanup processing just before an object is garage collected.
                  The finalize() method is used with the objects.
                  The finalize() method is executed just before the object is destroyed.

--> Difference between throw, throws?
       Throw:- Java throw keyword is used throw an exception explicitly in the code, inside the function or the block of code.
               The throw keyword is followed by an instance of Exception to be thrown.
       Throws:- Java throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare an exception which might be thrown by the function while the execution of the code.
                The throws keyword is followed by class names of Exceptions to be thrown.
