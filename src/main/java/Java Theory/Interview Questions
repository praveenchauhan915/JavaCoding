--> What is the difference between '=' and '=='?
    '==' is used to perform comparison operation and '==' is called as relational operators.
    '=' is used assign value to the variable and '=' is called as assignment operators.

--> What is the difference between '&' and '&&'?
   In single '&' if the first expression is false it will check for 2nd expression also.
   But '&&' if the first expression is false then it will not check 2nd expression(It would be considered as false itself).

--> Can we use all the method inside the the SOPln?
    Yes, we can call all the method except the method return type is void.
     Example:- public class calculator
               {
                  int add(int a, int b){
                        int c = a+b;
                        return c;
                  }
                  void sub(int x, int y){
                        int z = x-y;
                        S.O.Pln(z);
                  }
                  void mul(int p, int q){
                        int r = p*q;
                        S.O.Pln(r)
                  }
                  public static void main(String[] args){
                         Calculator c = new Calculator();
                         S.O.Pln(c.add(20,10));
                         c.sub(20,10);
                         c.mul(10,10);
                  }
               }
