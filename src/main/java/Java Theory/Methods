--> A method is just like function which performs some functionality is called method.
--> A method can take any number of inputs parameters.
--> Every method has a return type.
--> If the method is not returning any thing inside then we have to write the return type as a void.
--> Return is the last logical statement inside the method.
--> A method can return only one value at a time but it can return more than one value by using arrays concept.

-->Method Overloading:- In a class having more then one method having same name but different input parameter.
--> Different Parameter in the sense
    --> We can change the input parameter
        Example:-
        int display(int i){
         //statement
        }
        int display(long l){
         //statement
        }
    --> We can change the datatypes
        Example:-
        int display(String s){
         //statement
        }
    --> We can change the sequence of parameter
        Example:-
        int display(int i,long l){
         //statement
        }
        int display(long l, int i){
         //statement
        }
--> In method overloading variable name should not be considered.
--> In method overloading return type should not be considered.
--> Advantage:- If we want to perform different action by using same method name then we should go for method overloading.

Method Overriding:- It is a process of giving child specific implementation by keeping parent method definition same.
                    By overriding the methods , method name, return type and input parameter must be same but implementation can be different.
                    Overriding is possible only in case of inheritance
                    Any number of methods can be overridden at any number of times.
                    Only methods can be overridden, but variables cannot be overridden.
--> In method overriding access modifier visibility will be
    --> If the parent class method is private then the clild class method can be private, default, protected or public.
    --> If the parent class method is default the child class method can be default, protected or public, but not private.
    --> If the parent class method is protected then the child class method can be protected or public, but not private or default.
    --> of the parent class method is public then child class method should be public, but not private, protected or default.
--> Method overriding is possible in case of inheritance.
--> Advantage:- It is the one way to give child specific implementation.
