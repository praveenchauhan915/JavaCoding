-->Access modifier in java are keywords that controls the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables and constructors.
--> Types of Access Modifiers:-
    --> Public:- It is highly visible access modifier in Java.
                 We can access anywhere in the class i.e. we can access inside the class, outside the class and outside the package.
    --> Private:- It is highly restricted modifier in Java.
                  It cannot access the private member outside the class.
    --> Default:- When we don't mention any access modifier explicitly then that member would be taken it as default.
                  We can access the default member inside the class  and outside the class.
                  We cannot access default member outside of the package.
    --> Protected:- We can access the protected members inside and outside of the class.
                  We cannot access protected members outside of the package.
                  But we can access only in case of inheritance.
