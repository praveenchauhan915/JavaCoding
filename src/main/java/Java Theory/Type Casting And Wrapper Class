--> Type casting is when assigning a value of one primitive data type to another datatype.
--> Types of casting
     --> Widening Casting:- Converting a smaller type to a larger type size.
                            Also called implicit type casting and up-casting.
                  byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
              Example:- int myInt = 9;
                        double myDouble = myInt;
     --> Narrowing Casting:- Converting a larger type to a smaller size type.
                             Also called explicit casting and down-casting.
                  double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
               Example:- double myDouble =9.78d;
                         int myInt = (int) myDouble;


--> Wrapper Classes:- Provide the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object to primitive.
              Primitive Type            Wrapper Class
                boolean                  Boolean
                char                     Character
                byte                     Byte
                short                    Short
                int                      Integer
                long                     Long
                float                    Float
                double                   Double
--> Type :-
          Autoboxing:- The automatic conversion of primitive data type into a corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing.
                       Example:- int--> Integer, long--> Long, char--> Character, short--> Short.
                       Code:-
                               int a = 20;
                               Integer i = Integer.valueOf(a); // Converting int into Integer explicitly
                               Integer j = a; // autoboxing, now compiler will convert Integer.valueOf(a) internally
          Unboxing:- The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing.
                     Code:-
                            Integer a = new Integer(3);
                            int i = a.intValue(); // converting Integer to int explicitly.
                            int j = a; //unboxing, now compiler will write a.intValue() internally
