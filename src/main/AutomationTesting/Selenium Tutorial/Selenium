--> Selenium is an open source (free) automated testing framework for validating web applications across multiple browsers and platform.
--> Selenium Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, including Java, C#, Python and others.
--> Selenium is the term for testing done using the Selenium testing tool.
--> Different Components of Selenium Suite:-
         Selenium IDE:- It is a Firefox/Chrome plug-in that is developed to speed up the creation of automation script by recording the user actions on the web browser and exporting them as reuseble script.
         Selenium RC:- It is a server that enables users to generate test scripts in their preferred programming language.
                       It accepts commands from the script and sends them to browser as Selenium core JavaScript commands, for browser to behave accordingly.
         Selenium Web Driver:- It is a programming interface that helps create and run test cases by directly communicating with the web browser and using its native compatibility to automate.
                               Unlike Selenium RC, it doesn't require an additional server to create and run test cases.
         Selenium Grid:- It allows parallel execution of tests on different browsers and operating system by distributing commands to other machines simultaneously.
