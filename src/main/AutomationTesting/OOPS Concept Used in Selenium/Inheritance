--> The mechanism in java by which one class acquires the properties(instance variable) and functionalities of another class is known as Inheritance.
--> We are creating Base Class in the automation Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits , Property files, Excels etc in the base class.
--> We extend base class in other classes such as Tests and Utility Class.
--> Example:- BaseTest.java
              public class BaseTest {
                 WebDriver driver;
                 public void setUp(){
                   driver = new ChromeDriver();
                   driver.manage().window().maximize();
                 }
                 public void tearDown(){
                    if(driver!=null){
                      driver.quit();
                    }
                 }
              }

              LoginTest.java
              public class LoginTest extends BaseTest {
                 public static void main(String[] args){
                     test.setUp();
                     // code of verification
                     test.tearDown();


                 }
              }
