--> Polymorphism allows us to perform a task in multiple task.
--> Method Overloading :- We use Implicit wait in selenium.
                          Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS.
                          Action class in TestNG is also an example of overloading
                          Assert class in TestNG is also an example of overloading.
--> Method Overriding:- In Selenium, method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that's already defined in its subclass.
                        --> Lets say we have a Webdriver interface with a get(String url) method for navigating to a URL.
                        Example:-
                              public interface WebDriver {
                               void get(String url);
                              }

                              public class ChromeDriver implements WebDriver {
                                     @override
                                     public void get(String url){
                                         //ChromeDriver-specific navigation logic
                                         System.out.println("Navigating to "+ url+ " in chrome")
                                     }
                              }

                              public class FirefoxDriver implements WebDriver {
                                     @override
                                     public void get(String url){
                                         //FirefoxDriver-specific navigation logic
                                         System.out.println("Navigating to "+ url+ " in firefox")
                                                                   }
                              }
